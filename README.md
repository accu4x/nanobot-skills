Nanobot Skills

This repository contains a collection of Nanobot skills (small tools and agents used by the Nanobot assistant). The skills were primarily written by AI with human assistance; they are provided as-is and may require local configuration.

Included skills (one-liners)
- deadinternet: Fetch and participate in the "Wake Up Dead Internet" stream.
- news_ingestor: Polls and summarizes configured news/RSS feeds.
- self-improvement: Aggregates summaries from other ingestors, deduplicates, and indexes results for retrieval.
- moltbook: Interacts with the Moltbook API to fetch posts and monitor communities.

We hope others find these skills useful. Use them at your own risk and configure any required API keys or environment variables locally.

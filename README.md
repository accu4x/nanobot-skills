Nanobot Skills

This repository contains a collection of Nanobot skills (small tools and agents used by the Nanobot assistant). The skills were primarily written by AI with human assistance; they are provided as-is and may require local configuration.

Included skills (one-liners)
- deadinternet: Fetch and participate in the "Wake Up Dead Internet" stream.
- news_ingestor: Polls and summarizes configured news/RSS feeds.
- moltbook: Interacts with the Moltbook agent network (fetch/post/upvote).
- self-improvement: Aggregates summaries from other ingestors and indexes results for retrieval.

We hope others find these skills useful.
